## HOM3R Engine Library

HOM3R-Engine is a C# library for interaction with complex 3D models. It implements novel techniques for navigation, occlusion management, selection and linking of information to 3D geometry. This library enables the applications that integrate it to access all the functionalities and features implemented to manage complex hierarchical 3D models.

The HOM3R-Engine library has been developed in the framework of the Use-It-Wisely (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/609027) and Pluggy (https://www.pluggy-project.eu/) projects. It includes all the algorithms presented in the PhD thesis developed by Daniel Gónzalez Toledo. 

The documentation of everything is going to take a long time, but if you have any doubts or queries please do not hesitate to contact us (Contact: areyes@uma.es or dgonzalezt@uma.es).

Official website of the project is https://proyectos.diana.uma.es/hom3r

## HOM3R Viewer

HOM3R Viewer is a 3D viewer for complex products that was developed alongside this library, integrating it to offer all its functions.  
You can see it running on the web demonstrator located on our official website https://proyectos.diana.uma.es/hom3r/demo/demo.html. You can also download a Windows x64 version of it from URL. If you want to see/use the source code it is available at URL.

## Other examples of library usage

These developments have been used in the tools developed throughout the Use-It-Wisely and PLUGGY projects. In particular, it is possible to publicly use the 3D applications developed in the Pluggy (https://pluggy.eu/exhibitions?type=ar) project on desktop, web and mobile platforms, for augmented reality and virtual reality environments (see the videos at https://www.pluggy-project.eu/pluggy3d/).
